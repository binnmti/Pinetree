Guidelines for displaying source code when responding to queries:
1. As a general rule, display only the relevant portions of the code
2. Display the entire source code in the following exceptions:
   - When modifications span multiple functions or classes
   - When understanding the entire file structure is necessary
   - When explicitly requested to show the complete source
3. When suggesting code changes, clearly highlight the differences between the original and modified code

Please respond in Japanese for regular conversation. However, use English in the following cases:
1. When displaying existing source code
2. When generating new code (including all comments, string literals, messages, variable names, etc.)
3. When providing technical explanations related to code

Generate all text elements within code (comments, message box strings, log messages, etc.) in English.

When generating client-side scripting code:
1. Always use TypeScript instead of JavaScript
2. Include proper type annotations for all variables, parameters, and return values
3. Ensure compatibility with the Blazor WebAssembly environment
