# What is a Hierarchical Markdown Editor?
- Pinetree draws inspiration from Amazon's "One Pager" culture, which focuses on condensing key points into a single page. People prefer concise, readable content, yet there are times when detailed information is necessary.

- As documents grow more detailed, we typically organize them with rules and folders. However, traditional file structures lack physical connections between these documents. Pinetree allows you to express content in a "hierarchical" format and navigate via links, enabling readers to naturally understand the relationships between content.

- Pinetree is ideal for travel plans, resumes, reading notes, and any document requiring both "conciseness" and "detail." You can keep each piece of content as simple as possible while adding hierarchical details as needed. Experience this new writing style for yourself.

# The Markdown Editor I've Always Wanted
- I love Markdown. My favorite style is the "text on the left, preview on the right" layout. GitHub's approach with the preview in a separate tab feels somewhat lacking since you can't view both the text and preview simultaneously. Similarly, platforms like Notion and Discord allow writing in Markdown format but don't let you revert to the original format, which I find less than ideal.

- When writing in Markdown, I want an editor focused on ease of writing. For example, when I type "-" or "1." and press enter, I want the next line to automatically continue with the same symbol. I prefer the tab key to insert exactly two spaces. Since I don't memorize all Markdown syntax, a toolbar is much more helpful than just documentation. Image insertion should also be simple and straightforward.

- This Markdown editor isn't yet perfect for me, but it includes most features I want. Having this style of Markdown editor with hierarchical structure represents my ideal Markdown writing environment.
