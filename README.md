## Pinetree is browser-based hierarchical markdown editor

# What Is a “Hierarchical” Markdown Editor?
- Pinetree is inspired by Amazon’s "One Pager" culture — a style of summarizing key points concisely in one page. People prefer short and easy-to-read texts, but there are also times when they want more detailed information.

- As the amount of text grows, we usually organize it with folders or naming rules. However, with traditional file structures, there is no real connection between related documents. In Pinetree, you can express your writing in a hierarchical structure and easily jump between sections using links. This helps readers understand how parts of the text relate to each other more naturally.

- Pinetree works great for documents that need both simplicity and depth — like travel plans, resumes, and reading notes. You can keep each part of the text simple while adding more detail in a structured, layered way. Try this new style of writing and see how it changes your workflow.

# My Ideal Markdown Editor
- I love Markdown. Especially the style where the text appears on the left and the preview on the right — that's the best. If the preview is in another tab, like on GitHub, it’s a bit less convenient since you can’t see both at once. And with tools like Notion or Discord, even though you can write in Markdown-like syntax, you can’t always go back to the original format — which doesn’t work well for me.

- When writing in Markdown, I want it to be optimized for ease. For example, when I type “-” or “1.” and press Enter, I want the next line to automatically continue the list. The Tab key should insert exactly two spaces. I don’t remember all Markdown syntax, so a toolbar instead of just help docs would be really helpful. Inserting images should also be easy.

- This Markdown editor isn’t perfect yet, but it has most of the features I want. Being able to write in this style and use a hierarchical structure makes it my ideal Markdown editor.

# Writing in Hierarchies Brings More Freedom
- While building Pinetree, I realized that a hierarchical structure is useful in many situations. The more you write, the longer the text becomes. For example, when taking reading notes, the summary gets longer and longer, and scrolling through it later can be a hassle. If you can organize the text into meaningful chunks — say, by chapter — you reduce the reading load and improve understanding.

- Some types of writing are naturally suited to a hierarchical approach. Take diaries or blogs, where you record entries by date. Organizing a month's worth of diary entries can be tough, but you could group them by week (Week 1 to Week 4), then nest them under a single month like “March.” Or, you could create a single file with all 12 months in a hierarchical format. There’s no one “correct” structure for writing — the beauty of hierarchy is its flexibility to fit different contents and purposes.

- Hierarchies also work well for travel plans. Travel ideas don’t always flow top-down by date. You might think, “I want to go to ___ on Day 3,” but plans shift as you write. A single text might be fine at first, but as the plan takes shape, it becomes easier to manage when split into “blocks.” Just like using tabs in a memo app, organizing your notes hierarchically lets you see the whole picture. It may not look perfectly neat, but having structure definitely helps with clarity and comprehension.
