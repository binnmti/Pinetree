# Pinetree
- Pinetree is browser-based hierarchical markdown editor

# What is a Hierarchical Markdown Editor?
- Pinetree draws inspiration from Amazon's "One Pager" culture, which focuses on condensing key points into a single page. People prefer concise, readable content, yet there are times when detailed information is necessary.

- - As documents grow more detailed, we typically organize them with rules and folders. However, traditional file structures lack physical connections between these documents. Pinetree allows you to express content in a "hierarchical" format and navigate via links, enabling readers to naturally understand the relationships between content.

- Pinetree is ideal for travel plans, resumes, reading notes, and any document requiring both "conciseness" and "detail." You can keep each piece of content as simple as possible while adding hierarchical details as needed. Experience this new writing style for yourself.
